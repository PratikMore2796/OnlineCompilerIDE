# OnlineCompilerIDE
The Online Compiler allows user to code in 4 different languages such as php, c, c++, python and NodeJS
## why tried Online Compiler
Using this compiler, I came to know how the compiler actually works and it is based on PHP, so all the tasks that I learnt while doing this project, helped to work with
I/O files.
## Please don't publish it on live server
The reason bihind this is, I created it just for knowledge, it uses Shell Script.
Shell Scripts can destroy your server if some hacker hack your website.
## If you like the code please let me know by forking and providing suggestions
