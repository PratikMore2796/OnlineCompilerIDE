# OnlineCompilerIDE
The Online Compiler allows user to code in 4 different languages such as php, c, c++, python and NodeJS
# Reason to create compiler
As my personal project in bachelors, I created a game, however, that was built on laravel I am not getting my old website back as a result I can't show my skills. I got a part of compiler, that I had built. I have modified it with bootstrap and created a new compiler.
#Challanges
The most difficult part is uploading the compiler on server as we have to install all the languages that we want to install. I have used PHP, NodeJS, Python, C and C++. Moreover, I tried to upload it as it is but it is still not working, I will update this once I got a way to upload it on server.
#New Things Learnt
While creating it, the desing was somwhat difficult, as I had used preloader, using bootstrap I am creating a responsive page. This is usefull when we need some specific task to be done and a editor will be needed to compelete the task. For example, It can be used while giving coding exam.

The Bachelor's project name was CodeFight. The main idea of project was to earn money by programming that encourges the programmer to learn more and compete with other programmer. However if a programmer is not getting job, He/she can use our platform as a source of income.
